#Project-TMDb-API
Project Overview
 
This project leverages the TMDb (The Movie Database) API to fetch and analyze information about movies, TV shows, and celebrities. The TMDb API provides a comprehensive source of data for entertainment purposes, allowing users to stay updated with the latest information in the entertainment sector.

Motivation


The motivation behind using the TMDb API is to create a tool that can:

Recommend TV shows, movies, and other entertainment content based on user preferences.
Provide information about upcoming TV shows and movies.
Identify the most popular and/or exclusive content at any given time.
